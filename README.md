**o** stands for **operation essentials** — a collection of Kubernetes addons and CLI tools for production operations.

Built primarily with [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) 1.91+ (except `cocd` in Go), these tools deliver operational advantages: minimal container sizes, low memory footprint, static binaries with no runtime dependencies, memory safety, and compile-time guarantees for production stability.
