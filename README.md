**o** stands for **operation essentials** — a collection of essential Kubernetes addons and CLI tools for cluster operations.

Built with [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) 1.92+, these tools deliver operational advantages: minimal container sizes, low memory footprint, static binaries with no runtime dependencies, memory safety, and compile-time guarantees for production stability.
